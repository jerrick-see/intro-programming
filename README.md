# Introduction to Programming
Welcome to my course! I am currently only teaching this to *one* student, but you are more than welcome to use my materials as reference. After each lesson, there are *two* challenges that accompany it. These challenges are indeed challenging. They may require more than the lesson has shown the student. This is where the instructor must provide plenty of extra help. The class model relies heavily on clear/concise communication from the instructor and that the students ask the "right" questions that get them on track.


## Lesson 1
Lesson 1 is not your average "syllabus day". We delve straight into learning what software we need and popular objects in Python.

- **Part 1: Software**
    - Github
    - Terminal
    - Jupyter Notebook (Python 3)
- **Part 2: Programming Concepts**
    - Data types
        - Words: Strings
        - Numbers: Integer / Float
        - Logical: Boolean
        - Assignment
    - Containers and indexing
        - Lists
        - Arrays (Numpy)
        - Dataframes (Pandas)
    - If-else statements


## Lesson 2
Lesson 2 gives the student their first look into object-oriented programming.

- **Part 0: Saving your work**
    - Committing changes to Github
- **Part 1: User Input**
    - Processing Keyboard Input
- **Part 2: Objects**
    - Creating an object
    - Defining methods with `def`
    - Data checking (if/else)
    - Using `+` to make strings
    - Commenting
- **Part 3: Putting it all together**
    - Improvements  
    - List of lists of multiple accounts
