    "CICO stands for \"calories in, calories out\". This is a type of paradigm we use to lose weight. While CICO is the baseline for weight loss, we will also need to track macronutrients. There are three macronutrients: protein, fat, and carbohydrates. In this challenge, we are going to create several useful objects to track calories and macronutrients of foods. This class will rely on user input, just like MyFitnessPal, to name the food, the serving size in grams, and the macronutrient content.\n",
